# bio-raum/gabi

**G**enomic **A**nalysis of **B**acterial **I**solates, or GABI for short, is a bioinformatic workflow to assemble bacterial genomes, annotate genes, detect antimicrobial resistance genes as well assign them to an (cg)MLST clustering schema. GABI supports both (Illumina) short reads and ONT/Pacbio long reads. Hybrid assembly approaches are supported for ONT/Illumina data sets and require for different read types to carry the same sample ID for grouping. Please see our [documentation](docs/usage.md) for detailed information.  

If you  are really impatient, check out our [quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) guide.
